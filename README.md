# pixi-viewport-gesture-pinch

A plugin for [pixi-viewport](https://github.com/davidfig/pixi-viewport) allowing
pinch-to-zoom behavior with the non-standard
[GestureEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GestureEvent)
API. Though this isn't on a standards track, it's necessary to support pinch to
zoom behavior on certain browsers (Safari).
